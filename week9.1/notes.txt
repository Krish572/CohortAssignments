Lets say we need to build a timer - first thought which comes is to build with the help of setInterval
-> Refer the code in practice/counter folder 
setInterval(()=> {
    setCount(count + 1)
}, 1000)
-> But this cannot make timer, it actually generates more times as time goes by...
-> As we know when ever state change then that particular componenet will re-render, this actually leads to initializing more setTimeouts. when setCount called in interval fun, that component re-renders and again a new setInterval will be initialized - to observe put a bunch of console.log in that component - as count increases logs will be exponential.

* By this problem there is something which react needs to provide which does not re-render (which just mounts at start of excecution) : Sol - useEffect() hook.
